Great! Here's a sample `README.md` tailored for your project that includes a `requirements.txt` and `Exercise.ipynb` (which contains the training script). This will help showcase your project cleanly on GitHub:

# Transformer Model Training Notebook

This repository contains a training pipeline for a transformer-based model using Hugging Face's `transformers` library. The training is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`Exercise.ipynb`) and can be run on both CPU and GPU (NVIDIA CUDA supported).

## üìÅ Project Structure


```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Exercise.ipynb       # Jupyter notebook with training scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # Project overview

````

## üöÄ Features

- Uses `transformers`, `datasets`, `accelerate`, and `torch` for model training
- GPU acceleration via PyTorch and Accelerate
- Progress tracking with `tqdm`

## üß∞ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
````

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   conda create -n pytorch python=3.10 -y
   conda activate pytorch
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ‚ö° Running the Notebook

Make sure you have an NVIDIA GPU and the correct CUDA version installed. Launch Jupyter and open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Exercise.ipynb
```

You should see GPU usage under `nvidia-smi` when running training cells.

## üñ•Ô∏è GPU Troubleshooting

- Check GPU availability in Python:
  ```python
  import torch
  print(torch.cuda.is_available())
  print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
  ```
- Monitor GPU usage during training:
  ```bash
  nvidia-smi
  ```

**Note**: If you encounter any issues running the notebook or using GPU, please refer to [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/) or [Hugging Face Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/).
